# ZEIT Now Examples

This is the public list of examples for **ZEIT Now**.

All of these ready to deploy examples feature a frontend framework or static site, created using the CLI tools they provide with zero configuration required.

The `+functions` examples feature an `/api` directory as well, highlighting how to use serverless functions on top of a framework, again with zero configuration required.

To get started using any of these examples as your own project, [install Now](https://zeit.co/download) and use either of the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
now init                    # Pick an example in the CLI
now init <example>          # Create a new project from a specific <example>
now init <example> <name>   # Create a new project from a specific <example> with a different folder <name>
```

Deploying your project takes seconds and can be done with **just a single command**:

```sh
now                         # Deploys the project with Now
```

With the `now` command, your project will be built and served by Now, providing you with a URL that can be shared immediately.
